# Goals

- Connect software licenses to FAIR principles

- .emph[Practical recommendations] for starting, contributing, reusing

- Practical recommendations for individuals, projects, group leads

- Help you navigating and deciding


## Not our goals

- Finding out which license is the best: it depends

- Remembering all the licenses

- Going into legal details

# FAIR principles and software

Researchers need to navigate many tools and concepts.

- Especially when combining codes or organizations
- Difficult to change

# Copyright

- .emph[creative expression] -> copyright
- idea -> patents
- name -> trademark

Copyright controls whether we can distribute
the original work or the derivative work
- "distribute-right"
- "change-right"

Code that we write is automatically protected by copyright practically
"forever" (lifetime of author + 70 years).
- (c) who exactly, though?

# Sampling/remixing

- Changing and distributing software is similar to changing and distributing
  music
- You can do almost anything if you don't distribute it


### Often we don't have the choice

- We are expected to publish software
- Sharing can be good insurance against being locked out


### Can we distribute our changes?

- ... with the research community or our future selves?
- .emph[Derivative work]
- Now it matters to look at licenses
