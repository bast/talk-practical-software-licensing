## Problem

- Open science without software licensing is not useful: reuse is then not possible or unclear at best

- UiT seems to lack **practical** guidelines about software licensing

- The existing guidelines are not easy to find
  - https://en.uit.no/research/innovation/art?p_document_id=754152
  - Title: "Employees: innovation and commercialization"

- Guidelines are not clear about ownership/copyright

- No recommendation for choosing software licenses

- No practical recommendations for what to do when license has been chosen either

## Guidelines/recommendations from various universities

- [Aalto university](https://www.aalto.fi/en/open-science-and-research/opening-your-software-at-aalto-university)
    - Summary: yes, you can open software and data and you need to ask only
      minimal permission (confirm your supervisor agrees).
- [UiT](https://en.uit.no/research/innovation/art?p_document_id=754152)
    - "Work results of a copyright nature belong to the author"
- [NTNU](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Guidelines+for+policy+for+Open+Science)
    - "Where no overriding guidelines exist, NTNU-produced software must be
      licensed under the European Union Public Licence."
- [UiB](https://www.uib.no/en/ub/106619/copyright-own-scientific-work)
    - "As a rule authors have copyright to their own work"
    - Encourage the use of CC-BY
- [UiO](https://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/funding/units/hf/imv/data-ethics/ipr.html)
    - "If the University chooses not to take steps to secure copyright
      protection and exploit the findings, the employees must be entitled to
      have these rights reassigned to them."

## Suggestion for a way forward

- We provide a clear guide and recommendation

- Draft of a guide: https://research-software.uit.no/blog/2023-software-licensing-guide/

- Collect and implement feedback (the draft has been through few feedback rounds already)

- Once we agree on the guide we make it a policy and publish it on
  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) as PDF (with a version, since it will evolve)

- From different websites we will then point to the Zenodo DOI
